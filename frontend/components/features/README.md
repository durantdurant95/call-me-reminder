# Features Components

This folder contains feature-specific components organized by domain:

- **auth/**: Authentication-related forms and components (login, signup)
- **reminders/**: Reminder CRUD components (form, card, list, filters, dialogs)
- **dashboard/**: Dashboard-specific widgets (stats cards, recent activity)

Each feature folder should contain components that are specific to that feature and not reused across different features.
